<p>For the favourite button all it is is a list and adding countries to the list.For the search bar you can search for keywords.
  And for the values it is a list again which is sorted from largest to smallest</p>    
<h2>Design Brief</h2>
<p>My goal is for my website to contain 3 main things. A search bar where you can search for specific countries and years.
<b>A button which sorts the values by greatest to least and when pressed again it is reversed. 
<b>Finally a favourite option. Were you can favourite specific countries and go back and look at the said countries at later times.</p>
