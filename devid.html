    <h1>Design Specifications</h1>
    <p>High Adolescent birth is a huge issue in the world today.People are having children at ages when they can not even support themselves.The data needs to be easy to understand and very simple for somebody who has no idea what they are looking at.My goal is for me to be able to show my website to 5 peers who do have not been introduced to the topic and for them to able to find the country the are looking for fast and to understand if the data is good or bad.Also at the bottom of my page some outline on what the issue is.</p>
    <h1>Feasible Designs</h1>
    <p>There are two different website outlines which are good possibilities.There would be a homepage which explains the website and where to go. There is a link to a second page which has all the data stored on the make the loading speed faster.First a pulldown bar would make the specific countries easier to find and when the country is chosen the data is put into a graph.The second design option has a link to where the json data can be downloaded.This webpage also has a seach bar where you can look up the specific country you want and then it displays the data in a box with each category then the amount.</p>
    <h1>Chosen Designs</h1>
    <p>I chose my first design because graphs are very simple to understand and a search bar could not show up the country if incorrect spelling was used or an extra space was added.The pulldown might take longer to find the specific country but it is less prone to error.This website also has an href, which means everytime that the first site is opened it doesnt need to download all of the data.Also with another website it keeps my code more clean and if I run into an error I will know which page it is on and be able to trouble shott much easier then if the json data was on the same page.</p>
